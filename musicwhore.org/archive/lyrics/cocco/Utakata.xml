			<verse>Houkago no koutei hi kanzakuraShiroi hiza kasa buta no ryouashiHana no oku tsukinukeru fuyu no yumeSono saki ni aru mono wo osoreteta</verse>
			<chorus>Kogane no mori toUuji no neiroWatashi no hoho waDoushite anna niKogoeteita no darou</chorus>
			<verse>Kurete yuku mainichi mo tomerarezuKowai no wa furande yuku chibusaMune wo kakinarasu sunabokoriTabun subete wa karamattaKaze ni osarete hashitteta</verse>
			<chorus>Yuugao saita umi made no michiWatashi no mimi waDoushite an'na niKogoeteita no darouKogane no mori to uuji no neiroWatashi no hoho waDoushite anna niKogoeteita no darouDoushite anna ni kogoeteita no darouNadaraka ni meguri koboreochiru deigo no namida</chorus>

		<lyric>
			<verse>School yards after school, cherry treesWhite knees, both legs with scabsWinter dreams sticking inside the noseI was frightened by what was ahead</verse>
			<chorus>Golden woods and the sound of the sugar grassI wondered why my cheeks were chilled that much</chorus>
			<verse>I couldn't stop the days from goingWhat scared me was my growing breastSandy dust strumming my heartMaybe everything was tangling each otherRunning and pushed by the wind</verse>
			<chorus>The way to the sea with flower blossomsI wonder why my ears were chilled that muchGolden woods and the sound of the sugar grassI wonder why my ears were chilled that muchWhy was I chilled that muchDeigo's tears flowing up and gently falling</chorus>
