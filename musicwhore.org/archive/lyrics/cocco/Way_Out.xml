		<lyric>
			<verse>I'll give you my eyesI'll even give you my earswithout any hestitationI thought I threw my expectationsaway long agonever to ask for your helpI'll give you everythingeven my lipsIf you get me out of here</verse>
			<chorus>Till when and what for?Till when and for whom?No matter how much I sufferedfrom my headacheNo matter how much deeper I descendedNo matter how much I spewed up bloodThere was no answer anywhereWho the hell am I?</chorus>
			<verse>I'll give you my bloodI'll decorate myself with ribbonsandI will give you everyuthingeven my tearsIf you carry me out of here</verse>
			<chorus>Till when and what for?Till when and for whom?No matter how much I sufferedfrom my headacheNo matter how much deeper I descendedNo matter how much I spewed up bloodThere was no answer anywhereThe lash for whipping my back was already brokenI still call for somebodyTell me where the way out isTell me where to goDon't leave me aloneDon't leave me alone</chorus>
			<verse>Tell me where the way out isTell me where to go</verse>
