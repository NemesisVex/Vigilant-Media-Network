			<verse>MAMA yuzuri no akage woFutatsu ni tabaneteMitsuami yuretetaNaze data no darou toIma mo omou keredoMada wakaranai yoShizuka ni seki wo tatteHasami wo nigirishimeteOsage wo kiriotoshita</verse>
			<chorus>Sore wa totemo hareta hi deMirai nante iranai to omottetaWatashi wa murayoku deKotoba wo erabezu niKaerimichi no nioi dakeYasashikattaIkiteikeruSonna ki ga shiteitaKyoushitsu de dareka ga warattetaSore wa totemo hareta hi de</chorus>
			<verse>Kami ga nakute kondo waUde wo kittemitaKireru dake kittaAtatakasa wo kanjitaChi ni mamireta ude deOdotte itandaAnata ga mou inakuteSoko ni wa nani mo nakuteTaiyou mabushikatta</verse>
			<chorus>Sore wa totemo hareta hi deNaku koto sae dekinakute, amari ni mo,Daichi wa hateshinakuSubete wa utsukushikuShiroi fuku de tooku karaGyouretsu ni narabezu ni sukoshi utattetaKyou mitaku ame nara kitto naketetaSore wa totemo hareta hi deMirai nante iranai to omottetaWatashi wa murayoku deKotoba wo erabezu niKaerimichi no nioi dakeYasashikattaIkiteikeruSonna ki ga shiteitaKyoushitsu de dareka ga warattetaSore wa totemo hareta hi de</chorus>

		<lyric>
			<verse>The red hair I got from my momBraided in twoSwaying in the windWhy, why, I still don't knowCalmly I stood upScissors in handAnd cut off those braids</verse>
			<chorus>It was a sunny dayThe future had no meaningI was helpless, had no wordsBut the scent of the way homeIt was tenderI can liveSomebody was laughingIt was a very sunny day</chorus>
			<verse>With no more hair,I cut off my armsKept cutting until I couldIt felt warmWithout youThere was nothing hereBut only the bright sun</verse>
			<chorus>It was a very sunny dayCouldn't even tryThe land had no limitBeauty surrounded meI was singing in a white dressThe line of people far awayI could've cried with a rain like todayIt was a sunny dayThe future had no meaningI was helpless, had no wordsBut the scent of the way homeIt was tenderI can liveSomebody was laughingIt was a very sunny day</chorus>
