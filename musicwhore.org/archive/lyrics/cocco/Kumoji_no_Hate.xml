		<lyric>
			<verse>from beyond the torn waves of skyShines a light guarding uscalmness comes neara tender frame burns withinwhen I remember that old page from the bibleI see you smile</verse>
			<chorus>if these eyes didn't know the lightthere wouldn't have been this thing I had to seeif this body didn't know youthere wouldn't have been this memory I drag</chorus>
			<verse>these fingers that play 6 stringsare too immature to save mekisses are buried in petalsas bells ring like biting sandsa little ballerina carrying her sorrowsang while licking her crushed toes</verse>
			<chorus>if these eyes didn't know the lightthere wouldn't have been this thing I had to seeif this body didn't know youthere wouldn't have been this memory I drag</chorus>
			<verse>i see you in the night full of oceanwith the light but forever unreachable</verse>
			<chorus>if little birds killed their voicesif those wings were crushed that dayif you had held mewould we still be melting with each other?if these eyes didn't know the lightthere wouldn't have been this thing I had to seeif this body didn't know youthere wouldn't have been this memory I drag</chorus>
