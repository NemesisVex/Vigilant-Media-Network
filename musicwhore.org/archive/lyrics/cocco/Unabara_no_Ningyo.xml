			<verse>Watashi wo hajimete daita hito waWatashi no tamenara shineru to ittaWatashi wa waratte sukoshi dakenaiteKokae ni suwatte kame wo hodoitaAoi neiki wa asu wo yumemiteHana ga saku no mo matezu ni kaji wo totta</verse>
			<chorus>Sora ga dore hodo takai no kaUmi no kanata deTsuki wa kujira to yogu no kaDoko made hitori toberu no kaWakai chikara wa afure dashita</chorus>
			<verse>Anata ga hajimete daita hito waAnata no senaka ni amaetenaita?Watashi no senaka ni hane na donakuteHoshi wa tooku de matataku bakariYoake no kanega itoshiku sottoSubete wo keseru wakedemonai kara</verse>
			<chorus>Sora ga dore hodo takai no kaUmi no kanata deTsuki wa kujira to yogu no kaOmoi dasu uso mo aru keredoAtarashii asa wo zenbu ageru</chorus>

		<lyric>
			<verse>The first man who made love to mesaid that he could die for meI smiled and cried a little,Sat in the shadow of woodsAnd undid my hairThe blue sound of sleepingDreamt of tomorrow,and grabbed the row without being able to waitfor the flower to bloom</verse>
			<chorus>How high is the sky?Wiill the whale swim with the moonfar out in the ocean?How far can I fly by myself?Young power has started overflowing</chorus>
			<verse>The girl you made love to first,Did she cry on your shoulder?There is no wing on my shoulderThe stars only wink from far awayThe hell in the dawnwon't be able to gently and lovingly erase everything</verse>
			<chorus>How high is the sky?Will the whale swim with the moonfar out in the ocean?There are some lies that I still recallI will give you all of this brand new meaning</chorus>
			<verse>I used to think that I should dieBut somewhere in my mind,I believed that I would survive alone</verse>
			<chorus>How high is the sky?I don't even remember who had been cryingfar out in the oceanI was washed away all the way to this placeThe we mermaid found love</chorus>
			<verse>Turu ratta turu turu rattaWith the smell that never disappearsWith the new smell,With the smell that I used to loveWith you I love</verse>
