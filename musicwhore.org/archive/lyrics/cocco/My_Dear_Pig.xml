			<verse>Your missionYes, what your have to achieveIs to get fat for meYou've eaten the most yummy foodsin this farm, haven't you?You'll be able to be proud of yourselfBeing sold more expensive thanYour mama</verse>

			<verse>I love youBaby, yes youI was just kiddingI am not gonna release youOn Sunday after the chruchLet's make you into sausageI will eat youEat you by myselfDon't worryI am not gonna leaveOne single drop of your bloodYou're my only baby</verse>
			<chorus>Your Mammy is a pigSo great pigBut she said everydayDon't eat meOh-oh please pleaseDon't eat meBOO she is no more</chorus>
