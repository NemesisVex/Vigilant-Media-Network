		<lyric>
			<verse>You were the absolutecenter of calm for meYour unsteady fawn legsYour long eyelashesShadowing doe eyes ...</verse>
			<chorus>I was chasing the jet trailsAnd you watched me tenderlyThat winter wentSo far away</chorus>
			<verse>You had the beautiful dollAnd that toy that I really wantedEven with the wrapping unopenedDid you know you thatyou were about tofly up to that sky?</verse>
			<chorus>You will leave that jet trail behindAnd fly even higher than anybody elseFly so far away ...</chorus>
			<verse>What was the last thingThose eyes were looking at?</verse>
			<chorus>I was chasing the jet trailsAnd you watched me tenderlyThat winter wentSo far away</chorus>
