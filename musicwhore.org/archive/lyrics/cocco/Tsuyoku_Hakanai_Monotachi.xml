			<verse>Aisuru hito wo mamoru tameTaisetsu na mono kizuki tameUmi e deta no neArashi no naka de tatatteTobbu no naka ikinobiteKoko e kita no neKono minato wa ii tokoro yoAsahi ga kieri na noSumitsuku hito mo iru no youYukkuri yasuminasaiTsukareta hane no iyasu no</verse>
			<chorus>*1Dakedo tobiuo no AACHI wo kugutteTakarajima ga mieru koroNani mo ushinawazu niOnaji de irareru to omou?Hito wa yowai mono yoTottemo yowai mono yo</chorus>
			<verse>Aisuru hito wo mirai nadoTooi me no mama iwanaideKoe ga kikoeru?Watashi no heya e irasahiAmai okashi wo agemashouDaite agemashouKataki chikai kawashita no neSonna no shitteru wa"Anna ni aishiatta" toNandomo tashiakame aiShinjite shima wo deta no ne</verse>
			<chorus>*2Dakedo tobiuo no AACHI wo kugutteTakarajima ni tsuita koroAnata no ohimesama waDareka to koshi wo futteru waHito wa tsuyoi mono yoTotemo tsuyoi mono yo*1 repeat*2 repeatHito wa tsuyoi mono yoSoshite hakanai mono</chorus>

		<lyric>
			<verse>you have gone on a journey to the seato save the one you loveand to build something importantyou have fought in the stormsurvived a squalland finally reached herethe harbor is such a nice placethe morning sun is so beautifulsome people even settle heretake a good restand ease your weary wings</verse>
			<chorus>*1just about when you pass throughthe arch of flying fishes andsee a treasure islanddo you really thinkyou can be the samewithout losing a thing?we are all weakreally really weak</chorus>
			<verse>don't speak to mewith your lost dazed eyesabout the future of your lovedo you hear the voice?come in to my roomI will give you sweetsI will hold you tenderlyI know you had sworn a vow"we were so much in love"you ascertained that many timesand left that island with strong beliefbut ...</verse>
			<chorus>*2just about when you pass throughthe arch of flying fishes andreach the treasure islandI am sure your lovely princesswould be shaking her hips with someonewe are strongreally really strong*1 repeat*2 repeatwe are strongand ephemeral</chorus>
