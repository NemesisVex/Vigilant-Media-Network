		<lyric>
			<chorus>* I want toPut your arms around meTangle around youTear you apart Break youSeduce you tenderlyDamage you, Strangle youand Sink your head in the oceanwe saw together</chorus>
			<verse>When I light the candleI find the roses dyingIt is time to change this room, isn't it?The petals are goneStarving in my bedLosing myself night by nightBlown by the wind, my arid soulMy empty body was trappedin the deep darkness</verse>
			<chorus>repeat *</chorus>
			<verse>Not now nor laterYou'll never meet suchan innocent girl as meMy empty body was trappedin the deep darkness</verse>
			<chorus>I want toKiss you deep, Whisper into youTaste you with my tongueLick you all overRide you wet and slick,and Come with youYour retreating shadowis creating more distanceBut I like it and that's allI want toPut your arms around meTangle around youTear you apart Break youSeduce you tenderlyDamage you, Strangle youI want toPut your arms around meTangle around youTear you apart, tear you apartTear you apart, Break youand Sink your head in the oceanwe saw together</chorus>
