		<lyric>
			<verse>It was like a flower bloomingIt was a sweet fairy taleThe first love I possessedWas frozen by the last dreamInside the door I wrenched open ...I've been always taughtTo end the story with a sad epilogue</verse>
			<chorus>I'll kidnap you and fleeI'll usurp your freedomeven if my arms get torn offeven if they are gonethere's no doubt I have no placeto go back to</chorus>
			<verse>Tangle our fingerslies would flow between our fingersdo you know that these lies will shineand turn their shape into the truth?Visible things reflected in my eyesare being destroyed then,with my handsI'll shape an invisible eternity</verse>
			<chorus>let's plow our way through everythingand get out of hereIf you are hesitating and cannot jump outI would cut you into small piecesand squeeze youlock you, hold you tenderlyand let you get on the trainI'll kidnap you and fleeI'll usurp your freedomeven if my arms get torn offeven if they are gonethe wind is blowingon the other side of the door I wrenched open</chorus>
