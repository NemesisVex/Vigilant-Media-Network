		<lyric>
			<verse>When my family lived togetherI was gazing at the GAJUMARU tree from the windowI'd been always climbing trees when I was youngMom called my name,"The cake is ready!"And I waved at her with a big smileOne day i woke and found myself aloneI was smoking instead of cryingSweet and gentle breeze from the parkLove was there and I was in itThat was enough for meI've been relieved cause I am freeI've been living my life for no particular reason</verse>
			<chorus>Somebody, stop mePut me down and bind me to that treeSomebody, stop me pleaseTie me to that tree so tightWhen the morning comesAm I going to be alive?Am I going to be alive?under the GAJUMARU tree</chorus>
			<verse>Riding piggyback on Papa and his soft hairThe vast grassland with the smell of summerI cried because his mustache hurtWas that the last time I cried?I shut the door on the memory of those tearsI said, "I have nothing to lose anymore"Then you hold meWell, I'm all rightBye-bye SayonaraI hate being chasedIt doesn't mean a thingI hate sweetsI've had enoughIt took a long time for meto forget the taste of the cakeBut you ...</verse>
			<chorus>Somebody, stop mePut me down and bind me to that treeSomebody, stop me pleaseTie me to that tree so tightWhen the morning comesAm I going to be alive?Am I going to be alive?under the GAJUMARU tree</chorus>
