<p><strong>logging in to the members page</strong><br>
In order to edit your account information or to post to the portal, you must first log in to your account. Click on the <strong><a href="/index.php/members/"{if $popup_flag==true} class="popup"{/if}>My Austin Stories</a></strong> link to log in.</p>

<p>If you click on the <strong>Save my information</strong> checkbox, a cookie will save your login and password. The next time you visit the site, you'll remain logged into your account. When you logout, all cookies are destroyed.</p>

<p>After you've logged in, you'll be redirected to your <strong><a href="/index.php/members/"{if $popup_flag==true} class="popup"{/if}>index</a></strong> page. Here, you can view the latest posts from your favorite member sites. (More information on create a favorites list is forthcoming.)</p>

<p><strong>Members with temporary accounts:</strong> If you were listed in <strong><a href="/"{if $popup_flag==true} class="popup"{/if}>Austin Stories</a></strong> before January 2003, you have a temporary account. Your login name is the e-mail address you used to request to be added to the original listings. Your password was randomly generated, and you must <strong><a href="/index.php/members/password/"{if $popup_flag==true} class="popup"{/if}>retrieve it</a></strong> to login.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> If you press the back button of your browser immediately after logging in, you might see the member index instead of the login page. The login prompt is replaced by the member index if login is successful. If it seems like your seeing the same page again, well, you are!</p>
