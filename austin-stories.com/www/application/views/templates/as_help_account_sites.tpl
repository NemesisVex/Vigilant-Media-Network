<p><strong>adding and editing sites</strong><br>
If you maintain more than one journal, you can add additional sites by clicking on <strong>Add a site</strong> in the <strong>My Sites</strong> box in the <strong><a href="/index.php/members/"{if $popup_flag==true} class="popup"{/if}>My Austin Stories</a></strong> navigation bar. You will be taken to a form, which is also used when editing your site information. Here are the fields you can fill out:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <strong>Identity</strong><br>
Choose an alias with which to associate a site. This option appears only if you have added an <a href="/index.php/help/topic/account_aliases/{if $popup_flag==true}1/{/if}">alias</a>.</p>

<p><li> <strong>Site name</strong> <em>(required)</em><br>
Enter the name of your site as you would like it to appear.</p>

<p><li> <strong>URL</strong> <em>(required)</em><br>
Enter the URL of your site. Include the prefix "http://". What you enter in this field will be shown exactly on the rest of the site.</p>

<p><li> <strong>URL of syndication feed</strong> <em>(optional)</em><br>
Enter the URL of your syndication feed. RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0 and Atom 0.3 are supported. Include the prefix "http://". What you enter in this field will be used to parse your syndication feed.</p>

<p><li> <strong>Do you want this site listed in the directory?</strong><br></strong>
At any time, you may remove your site from the front page listing by answering "No" to this question. Your site will remain in the database, but it will not be listed. This option is ideal if you go on a temporary hiatus.</p>
