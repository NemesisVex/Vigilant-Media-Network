<strong>notes about deletions</strong><br>
The administration pages of <strong><a href="/index.php/members/"{if $popup_flag==true} class="popup"{/if}>My Austin Stories</a></strong> allow you to delete different types of records from the database. Whether you're deleting a site or a portal entry, please keep in mind <em><strong>all deletions are permanent</strong></em>.

<p>You will be asked to confirm your deletion twice. If you indeed wish to delete a record from the database, click on the <strong>[Yes]</strong> button, then click <strong>[OK]</strong> when your browser prompts you a second time. Click <strong>[Cancel]</strong> at the second prompt or <strong>[No]</strong> at the first prompt if you change your mind about deleting the record.</p>

<p>Instead of deleting a site from the database, you should unlist it. Read <strong><a href="/index.php/help/topic/account_sites/{if $popup_flag==true}1/{/if}">adding and editing sites</a></strong> for more information.</p>
