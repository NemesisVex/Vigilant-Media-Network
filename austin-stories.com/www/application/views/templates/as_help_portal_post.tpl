<p><strong>posting and editing portal entires</strong><br>
The form to post portal entries is the same as editing them. When editing portal entries, the original text of the entry and all other fields will be filled.</p>

<p>If you maintain more than one site, you will be shown a select menu to choose the site for which you wish to write a portal entry. If not, the site listed in the database will be shown as the default.</p>

<p>A preview of your post appears at the top of the screen. As you edit, your changes are reflected in the preview. Please make sure JavaScript is enabled in your browser for this function to work.</p>

<p>Here are the fields you fill:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <strong>Headline</strong> <em>(required)</em><br>
The headline is used as a link to the specific entry you wish to pimp in the portal. If you do not use titles for your journal entries, you may specify an entry date instead.</p>

<p><li> <strong>URL to entry</strong> <em>(required)</em><br>
Most journals are structured to link directly to individual entries. You may fill this field with that URL. You may also link the front page of your site if you choose, but keep in mind the dynamic nature of most online journals may make those links obsolete.</p>

<p><li> <strong>Portal text</strong> <em>(required)</em><br>
There is only one hard and fast rule when it comes to posting an entry to the portal: you must limit your text to 50 words. (JavaScript will check your word count automatically).</p>

<p>In terms of style, please keep the following guidelines in mind:</p>

<p><ul>
<li> <em>Let your excerpt be a complete thought.</em> Please refrain from stopping your entry in mid-thought. If you're using Movable Type's Trackback ping, use the "Excerpt" box instead of letting MT selecting the first 30 words of your entry.

<li> <em>Refrain from using HTML in your posts.</em> Austin Stories does not translate new lines into paragraphs or breaks. Although you may add tags manually, please limit them to anchor tags and sparse formatting, such as bold and italic text. No image tags and no paragraph tags.

<li> <em>Change special quotes and punctation into standard entities.</em> Cutting and pasting from such word processing programs as Microsoft Word may introduce special characters not conducive for export to XML. Although the scripts attempt to catch most special characters, you can help out by being your own filter.

<li> <em>Link to a specific entry URL.</em> Although some journals and weblogs list multiple entries on the index page of a site, it's best to link directly to a specific archived entry. Because of the dynamic nature of some sites, a simple link to an index page can be outdated very quickly.

<li> <em>Use a nut graf.</em> Don't be content to use just the first few sentences of your entry.

<li> <em>Choose your entries carefully.</em> Austin Stories is not a weblog newsfeed provider. Popular memes such as the Friday Five are widespread enough not to need further exposure.
