<p>Around 1998, an explosion of <em>'burbs</em> -- categorized lists of online journals, abbreviated from the word "suburbs" -- littered the Internet. One of those lists was Austin Stories, a directory of online journals written by writers based in and around Austin, Texas.</p>

<p>Shortly after the creation of Austin Stories, a number of Austin-based journal writers tossed about the idea of a city-wide get-together. <strong>Matt Sturges</strong> and <strong>Jette</strong> eventually organized the very first meeting in November 1999, but it was <strong><a href="http://nueces.diaryland.com/">Estoy Nueces</a></strong> writer <strong>Janice</strong>, a.k.a. "Pecan", who proposed the idea of a regular meeting -- one that happened every month with an open attendance policy. Whoever could make it, would, and whoever couldn't make it would wait for the following month.</p>

<p>The first of these meetings happened in March 2001 and are still going on.</p>

<p>Austin Stories soon became something of a bookmark page where meeting attendees could visit the sites of their fellow journal writers. As the meetings became routine, two sites -- <strong><a href="http://www.damnhellasskings.com/">Damn Hell Ass Kings</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.threewayaction.com/">Threewayaction</a></strong> -- set the standard for the <em>online journal portal</em>, a weblog-style page where journal writers plug their latest entries.</p>

<p>In 2002, <strong><a href="http://www.musicwhore.org/">Musicwhore.org</a></strong>, the site which hosted Austin Stories as a "'burb", relaunched exclusively as a music site. The site's online journal content was redistributed to other sites, and <strong><a href="/">Austin Stories</a></strong> was spun off into its own site.</p>

<p>Now, <strong><a href="/">Austin Stories</a></strong> is a portal geared for Austin online journal writers and the readers who love them. "Austin", in this case, also includes Central Texas. We won't split too many hairs if you live in New Braunfaels or Georgetown. And "Austin" also means folks who lived here and now live elsewhere -- Chicago, Los Angeles, wherever.</p>

<p>The site also hosts the <a href="/meetings.php">calendar</a> for the monthly meetings which have made the Austin journal community close-knit. For updates and news, the best source for information would be the <strong><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/austexjournal/">austexjournal</a></strong> group on Yahoo!Groups. Subscribe today!</p>

<p><strong><a href="/">Austin Stories</a></strong> may be a directory and a portal now, but it will continue to change, doing its best to keep the city's journal-writing community tight.</p>

<p>Enjoy your visit!</p>
