<strong>about account aliases</strong><br>
<p><strong>Aliases</strong> allow you to add a site to your account under a different name. The <a href="/index.php/directory/"{if $popup_flag==true} class="popup"{/if}>directory</a> lists the alias with that site instead of your Austin Stories identity. Your posts will also be attributed to the alias.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Signing up for multiple accounts on Austin Stories is prohibited. Use aliases to maintain multiple sites with different identities.</p>

<p>To add an alias, click on <strong>Add an alias</strong>. Fill in the text field with your alias, and click <strong>[Add]</strong>.</p>

<p>To edit or delete an alias, click on <strong>Edit/delete an alias</strong>. If editing an alias, fill in the text field with your alias, and click <strong>[Edit]</strong>. If deleting an alias, confirm the deletion by clicking <strong>[Yes]</strong>.</p>

<p>When you edit your site information, a selection box appears to allow you to choose an alias with which to associate your site.</p>
