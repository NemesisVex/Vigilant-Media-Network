<p>

As we expected, the <a href="hotel.php">JournalCon room block at the Omni</a> has been filled. 
 If you are planning on attending Web Writers Weekend and have not made accommodation arrangements,
  you need to call our overflow hotel, the <a href="http://www.radisson.com/austintx/" target="_blank">
  Radisson on Town Lake</a>.  They have a handful of rooms that they are saving in a block for us, 
  which will be available beginning Saturday, August 30.  They are only holding these rooms until 
  September 17.  <b>If you have not made hotel arrangements by that time, you will need to research
   other Austin hotels to find accommodations on your own.

The Radisson is a lovely hotel right on the banks of the Colorado River (what the locals call
 "Town Lake").  If the bats are still flying in October, you will have a front-row seat.  You 
 can take a virtual tour of the hotel and rooms and see their list of amenities 
 <a href="http://www.radisson.com/austintx/" target="_blank">at the hotel's website</a>.  
 The Radisson is on a downtown shuttle route that runs straight up to the Omni and back.  
 Also, a cab from one to the other would be about $3, or a pedi-cab is whatever you choose 
 to pay.  The hotels are about six blocks apart, and the Radisson is just as convenient to 
 the downtown Austin entertainment districts. Rooms at the Radisson are $129 per night, and
  are available in a king or double, smoking or non- (price does not include tax).

<p>
You need not be registered for the conference to reserve rooms at the Radisson. Attendees
 will be responsible for their own reservations. We cannot guarantee the reserved rate once
  that block is gone, so we encourage you to make your hotel arrangements right away.  As happened 
  with the Omni, it is likely that the Radisson room block will fill before the cut-off date of
   September 17.  You should not wait until the last minute.
   </p>
<p>
The Radisson has the same reservation procedure: a credit card must be used to reserve a room,
 but it will not be charged until check-out. "Absolutely no advance charges" was promised to us
  in writing by the hotel. Upon check-in, the equivalent of one night's stay will be held against
   the credit card, but not actually charged; upon check-out, guests may choose to pay however 
   they like. If the credit card is not used, the hold will be released.
   </p>
   <p>
If you need to cancel your reservation with the Radisson, <b>you must call by 6:00 pm on the day 
you are scheduled to check in</b>, or risk penalties.</p>

<p>
Parking is available at the hotel for $15.00 for overnight valet, and $10.00 for covered overnight 
self-parking with in-and-out privileges.
