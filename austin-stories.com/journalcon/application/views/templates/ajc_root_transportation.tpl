<a name="airport"></a>
<h5>To and from the airport</h5>
<p>
Taxis are available outside baggage claim, and will run about $20 to or from
the hotel. This is  definitely the most comfortable and fastest option - and
if you can plan to arrive/depart around the same time as other attendees and
split the fare, it is a reasonable expense. Expect to spend about 20 minutes
in transit from gate to door.
</p><p>
The <a href="http://www.supershuttle.com/htm/cities/aus.htm" target="_blank">Super Shuttle</a> is
about $10 per person one way.  Near the Austin airport baggage claim there
is a counter (look for the blue sign) where you can catch the next shuttle
with no reservation needed, payable by cash or credit card.  The hotel can arrange
for the shuttle back at the end of your trip; you will need cash to pay the
driver for that run. Expect to spend about 30 minutes in transit from gate
to door.
</p><p>
The most affordable option is the 50-cent 
<a href="http://www.capmetro.austin.tx.us/routes/airport.htm" target="_blank">Airport Flyer</a>, an Austin bus
service. There is a downtown stop one block from the Omni. Expect to spend
45-60 minutes in transit from gate to door.
</p>
<a name="ground"></a>
<h5>Ground transportation</h5>
<p>
There is an <a href="http://www.amtrak.com" target="_blank">Amtrak station</a> about five miles
from the hotel.  There is no nearby Austin bus stop, so transportation from
the station to the hotel will have to be by taxi, and will run $5-10.
</p><p>
There is a <a href="http://www.greyhound.com" target="_blank">Greyhound station</a> about ten miles
from the hotel.  There are Austin bus stops at the station; alternately a
cab will run about $10.
</p>
<a name="town"></a>
<h5>Getting around town</h5>
<p>
The conference hotel was selected for its walking proximity to the major
downtown entertainment centers. There are loads of restaurants, shops and
services within five blocks.
</p><p>
Additionally, Austin has a free downtown shuttle service called the Dillo,
which can take you to the ultra-funky
<a href="http://www.firstthursday.info/" target="_blank">South Congress Avenue</a> district,
the ultra-swanky <a href="http://austin.about.com/library/weekly/aa102500a.htm" target="_blank">
West Sixth Street</a>
district, or the famed <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/austin/drag/" target="_blank">Drag</a>
bordering the University of Texas.
</p>
<a name="cars"></a>
<h5>Rental cars</h5>
<p>
If you are flying in and staying at the Omni, there won't be much need for a
rental car. Still, <a href="http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/austinairport/transportation.htm"  
target="_blank">here are the
rental car companies</a> with counters at the Austin airport.  Check out
the <a href="hotel.php">Hotel page</a> for parking rates at the Omni. Free parking on the
streets downtown is relatively easy to find during the day, compared to
other cities, but will be more difficult in the evening. Surface pay lots
are scattered around the hotel also.
