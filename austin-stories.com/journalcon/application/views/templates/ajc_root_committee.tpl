Tim of <a href="http://www.timbrat.net" target="_blank">Tim's Lounge</a>

<p>
Declared by Tim to be The Best Site You're Not Reading, Tim's Lounge has
been around in one form or another for about
two and a half years. Tim is a man of many interests, which of course makes
for an interesting site. Recent adventures that have been lovingly recapped
and described on his site include his many trips to large discount retailers
at midnight, weekends of sin with many fellow hirsute hefty gay men, and
bitchy captions he's added to random photos he finds on the web. Tim is the
Information Systems Director for a non-profit, and he loves his job very,
very much.

Devota of <a href="http://www.devota.org" target="_blank">devota.org</a>

<p>
"I started a web log on a whim last year. I wanted to do a digest of
my life so that my friends all over the world could just click and find
out what I am up to. I am told I lead an exciting life and always get
questions about what I am up to. I work in the music industry, I have
been doing that for 20 some years. I have been on the edge of the web
for the boom and the bust of the .com. I also like NASCAR racing, am
involved in local/Texas politics. I travel frequently, have a full time
job and just have a good fun life."

Rachel of <a href="http://www.waterlilies.org" target="_blank">A Day in the Life</a>

<p>
Rachel has been journalling for almost three years now.  If you ask her nicely, she might tell you where to find the juicy stuff.
She has lived in Austin for eight years and has a hard time imagining living anyplace else.  She wants you to come visit Austin, too, so you
can see what all the fuss is about. Please don't move here, though -- the job market is bad enough as it is!
