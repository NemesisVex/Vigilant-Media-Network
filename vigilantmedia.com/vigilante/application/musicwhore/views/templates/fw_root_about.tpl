<p>I am not a movie expert. In fact, <a href="/">Filmwhore.org</a> is little more than a brand extension of my music site, <a href="{$config.to_musicwhore}">Musicwhore.org</a>. The last thing I am is a whore for film. Hell, I still get Bill Pullman and Bill Paxton mixed up.</p>

<p>But my friend <a href="http://www.celluloideyes.com/">Jette</a> encouraged me to write movie reviews, and I figure it would be a good challenge to write about a topic for which I have no experience.</p>

<p>I could expound endlessly about the inner workings of the music industry, but I have no clue how the hell Hollywood works. And that kind of perspective might be useful for mere mortals who just want to know if something is any good.</p>
