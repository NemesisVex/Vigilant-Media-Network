<p>At the moment, <a href="/">Musicwhore.org</a> is a weblog covering music. Plain and simple. But this site has gone through multiple redesigns, who knows what I'll do with it next?</p>

<p>Although I pretty much write about what I'm listening to, a good portion of that is rock and pop music from Japan. Don't expect to find much idol pop, anime or visual kei, though. I do leave plenty of room for Western music, although I notice a particular slant toward 20th (and 21st) century classic music, college rock from the '80s and independent gay and lesbian artists.</p>

<p><a href="/">Musicwhore.org</a> traces its roots back to a print 'zine I published in 1997, which lasted all of two issues. From 1998 to 1999, I moved the zine online, where it was neglected even further. Some of the earliest reviews from 1999 and 2000 were taken from this original online zine.</p>

<p>I bought the domain name <a href="/">Musicwhore.org</a> in 2000 and relaunched the site. That same year, I got into Japanese popular music and spun off a specialty site named <strong>J~E</strong>.</p>

<p>When the economy started going sour in 2002, I folded <strong>J~E</strong> back in to <a href="/">Musicwhore.org</a>, and the site became an interactive webzine, with full-length streaming audio, reviews, news and an artist directory.</p>

<p>The demands of that site burned me out in 2005, and I cut back on the amount of content I produced. The remnants of that interactive webzine can be found at <a href="http://archive.musicwhore.org/">Archive.Musicwhore.org</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/">Musicwhore.org</a> still features reviews and news (translated or otherwise) but also adds a bit of punditry.</p>

<p>And for some music-related writing a little less formal, check out my journal on <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/NemesisVex/journal/">Last.fm</a>.</p>
