<strong>editing account information</strong><br>
<p>To change your login name, e-mail address, real name or password, click on <strong>Edit my account info</strong> in the <strong>Account info</strong> box in the <strong><a href="/index.php/members/"{if $popup_flag==true} class="popup"{/if}>My Austin Stories</a></strong> navigation bar. Here are the fields you fill out:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <strong>Login</strong> <em>(required)</em><br>
This is the login name you use to access your account. If you choose to use your login name instead of your real name on the site (see below), your portal posts will reflect those changes. So if you posted one day, changed your login name, then posted the next day, your post from the previous day will show your new login name.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Members with temporary accounts use their e-mail addresses as login names. The first time you log into a temporary account, you will be asked to select a new login name. It's <em>strongly recommended</em> that you do <em><strong>not</strong></em> use your e-mail address as a login name. It will be viewable to the public, as well as SPAM 'bots.</p>

<p><li> <strong>E-mail address</strong> <em>(required)</em><br>
In case you need to be contacted about your account, you must provide a working e-mail address. <strong><a href="/"{if $popup_flag==true} class="popup"{/if}>Austin Stories</a></strong> does not sell nor publish e-mail addresses. They're kept strictly for contact purposes only.</p>

<p><li> <strong>First and last name</strong> <em>(optional)</em><br>
If you do not wish to use your login name as your public identity on the site, please provide at least a first name.</p>

<p><li> <strong>What name do you want other users to see on the site?</strong><br>
Some writers wish to use their real names on their journals. Most often use an alias. You can flag this option to use your real name, if you choose.</p>

<p><li> <strong>Location</strong> <em>(optional)</em><br>
If you no longer live in the Central Texas area, please fill this field with your location. You can be specific (e.g., New York City, NY) or creative (The Ninth Circle of Hell, CA).</p>

<p>If you live within a 30- to 40-minute driving distance from Austin, Texas, you do not need to fill in this field. People who live in San Marcos, New Braunfaels, Round Rock or Georgetown live close enough to Austin; people who live in Dallas, Houston or San Antonio don't.</p>

<p><li> <strong>Change password</strong><br>
If you wish to change your password, you will need to specify your old password, type in a new password, then confirm that new password. <strong>Do not</strong> fill these fields if you are not going to change your password.</p>
</ul>
