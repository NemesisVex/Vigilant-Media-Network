<h3>Musicwhore.org</h3>

<p>Musicwhore.org started out as a short-lived print zine, then relaunched as a webzine.</p>

<p>In reality, Musicwhore.org is my learning laboratory -- whenever I want to teach myself a new scripting technique, I experiment with Musicwhore.org.</p>

<p>In addition to building an artist directory complete with album and song information, I integrated (and extended) Movable Type as a content manager. Movable Type handles RSS feeds and search, but content delivery is handled by scripts which were adapted from a custom-built CMS I have since obsoleted.</p>

<p>I also built an online store through Amazon.com's XML web services, integrating it with my database of artists, albums and reviews. The store didn't result in a lot of referals, so instead, I paired Amazon's web services with the Musicbrainz web service to deliver globalized content.</p>

<p>A custom-built account system allowed users to listen to streamed MP3s of artists featured on the site. I ran a separate web server to host audio content, which was delivered through ShoutCAST and a free version of RealNetwork's Helix server. I have since shut down the audio server.</p>

<p>I wrote the content of the site as well, translating music news items from Japanese into English and providing album reviews of American and international artists as well.</p>

<p>In September 2005, I relaunched the site as a weblog and turned the webzine into an archive. I also launched a film review site, Filmwhore.org, using the same backend as Musicwhore.org. Filmwhore.org also integrates film information from the Amazon web service with site content. TVwhore.org followed soon after, but both sites have become neglected step-children compared to its older sibling.</p>

<h3>Austin Stories</h3>

<p>Austin Stories first debuted in 1999 simply as a list of web writers in Central Texas who keep online journals.</p>

<p>As a community of these writers began to develop, the list was relaunched as a &quot;portal&quot;, by which readers can follow their favorite writers. A journal writer wishing to post to the portal must first register for an account. (The writer must also demonstrate some familiarity with the Central Texas area.)</p>

<p>Once approved, members may then post to the site whenever they update their own journals or weblogs. Austin Stories also supports Movable Type's Trackback system, allowing members to send pings instead.</p>

<p>Austin Stories does require a degree of editorial judgment, so even though it accepts pings, members must still make sure their posts conform to publishing guidelines.</p>

<p>If members provide URLs of their RSS feeds, Austin Stories can parse and aggregate them, allowing readers even more ways to keep up-to-date.</p>

<h3>Eponymous 4</h3>

<p>Eponymous 4 is my solo music project, and the official site provides news and audio content to listeners. Because I've decided to release my own music through online channels, I created a system by which I can control the availability of album information and audio files, allowing me to prepare material in advance but making it available over time. To prevent unscrupulous search engines from misrepresenting my content, links to audio files are obfuscated.</p>

<h3>JournalCon registration system</h3>

<p>When Austin was selected to host JournalCon 2003, I volunteered to host the official site and to develop an online registration system.</p>

<p>I also wrote an administrative interface to help conference organizers keep track of who paid for their registration fees. Although JournalCon is a grassroots event, the 2003 site marked the first effort to automate its registration process.</p>

<p>The system has since been used for the 2004 and 2005 conventions.</p>
