<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Vigilante started out as a custom-built content management
system for the webzine Musicwhore.org. Parts of that CMS source code were
reused to power other custom-made sites, including the online journal portal
Austin Stories and the online registration for JournalCon 2003.</p>

<p>Despite sharing some common functions, each site was built
with its own database design, creating redundant code that was difficult to
maintain. An improvement made to one site could not easily be made on another.</p>

<p>So Vigilante was started as a way to extract all that common
code into a foundation by which other sites may be built, while remaining
highly customizable.</p>
