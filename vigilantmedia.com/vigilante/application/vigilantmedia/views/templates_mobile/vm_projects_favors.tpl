<h3>Andre&aacute; Alford wedding site</h3>

<p>Frustrated with the commercial wedding site she was using, my friend Andy asked me to build a website for her April 9, 2005 wedding.</p>

<p>The couple didn't really have a decent photo of themselves, so I suggested that they head to an Amy's Ice Cream location and spend a few dollars goofing around in the photo booth. I took those photos and, with a little help from Photoshop, turned them into the main design element for the site.</p>

<p>I got the idea for using a photo booth from the back cover of Duran Duran's second self-titled album, better known as <em>The Wedding Album</em>.</p>

<p>The site is no longer running on account that the marriage was a mistake.</p>

<h3>Astrofish.net</h3>

<p>&quot;Twenty lines of code, and it changed my life,&quot; Kramer Wetzel told me after I wrote a script to automate the publishing of his horoscopes.</p>

<p>Kramer writes his astrology column weeks in advance, but to publish his horoscopes on Thursday mornings, he had to make sure a computer with Internet access was available on his travels.</p>

<p>He asked me whether it was possible to automate publication. I said it was.</p>

<p>Kramer's file system, luckily, was based on dates, and it allowed me to parse the file names through PHP and compare them with a timestamp.</p>

<p>The script reads in a list of publishable file names, determines which one of those files falls within that particular publishing week and displays it -- without Kramer having to step near a computer.</p>
