<p>In 2000, I wrote my first scripts in PHP, and eventually, I built web sites which became my learning laboratory for web software development. Over the years, pieces of code got recycled over and over again to the point where maintaining all that code became inefficient.</p>

<p>So in 2003, I sifted through all those projects, extracted the code common to them and laid a foundation on which other sites may be built.</p>

<p>This site documents the core pieces of that code. I've called the project <strong>Vigilante</strong>, as a play on <strong>Vigilant Media</strong>. (There's nothing philosophical behind the name.)</p>

<p><strong>Vigilante</strong> powered all the dynamic content of my various web sites: <a href="http://www.musicwhore.org/">Musicwhore.org</a>, <a href="http://www.filmwhore.org/">Filmwhore.org</a>, <a href="http://www.austin-stories.com/">Austin Stories</a>, <a href="http://www.eponymous4.com/">Eponymous4.com</a> and other projects in the <a href="http://www.vigilantmedia.com/">Vigilant Media</a> family. I didn't know it at the time, but what I was really creating was a web development framework, but it had none of the elegance of such popular frameworks as Ruby on Rails or CakePHP.</p>

<p>In 2008, I decided to deprecate <strong>Vigilante</strong> and move all my sites to <a href="http://codeigniter.com/">CodeIgniter</a>. I no longer wanted to maintain both the framework and the site content themselves. I've decided to keep this <a href="/index.php/vg/docs/">documentation</a> in place as an early demonstration of my development experience.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting.</p>
