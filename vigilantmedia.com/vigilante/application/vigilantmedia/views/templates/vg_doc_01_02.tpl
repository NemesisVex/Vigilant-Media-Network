<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Form-to-database mapping</strong><br/>
		Developers can match fields of a web form to the fields of a database, and Vigilante writes only those values on the form that has changed.</li>
	<li><strong>Object-oriented database interface</strong><br/>
		Vigilante provides a rudimentary class to handle database queries for individual records. Programmers can extend this class to suit the needs of their own database design.</li>
	<li><strong>XML parsing</strong><br/>
		If part of a web site uses XML to generate content, Vigilante's XML library can read and parse XML data, then save it into an associative array for formatting. Remote URLs and local files are supported.</li>
	<li><strong>Smarty template engine</strong><br/>
		Vigilante employs the Smarty template engine to render HTML output.</li>
</ul>
