<h3>Supportkids online application and data entry</h3>

<p>I started out at Supportkids as a technical liason for the content staff. My job was to wade through ASP code to find appropriate spots to insert content. It was a job not technical enough for a developer, but too technical for a content creator.</p>

<p>Soon after I was hired, I moved on to web development. My biggest project was refining a web-based application for in-house data entry. I performed support duties for the data entry staff, and I monitored customer feedback regarding the company's online application.</p>

<p>Supportkids used a Microsoft platform -- Windows as a web server, SQL Server as a database and ASP for web development. I have not developed on a Microsoft platform since, but that experience did prepare me to work with PHP and MySQL.</p>

<h3>NI TechComm: Icon database interface</h3>

<p>The Technical Communications department of National Instruments provides on its Intranet site a glossary of icons created for NI software. Unfortunately, the unwieldy structure of the glossary made it difficult to update easily, creating a backlog of icons to be added.</p>

<p>An XML-based solution was developed to simplify maintenance of the glossary, but the backlog itself made manual updates to the XML glossary daunting and tedious.</p>

<p>I volunteered to develop a web-based interface, powered by a MySQL database, that maintained all the components of the glossary. This interface builds the XML glossary, parses the XML into HTML, then publishes the HTML to the Intranet through a synchronization with our configuration management system, Perforce.</p>

<h3>NI TechComm: HTML/FrameMaker conversion tools</h3>

<p>National Instruments documentation is made available through printed manuals, PDFs and compiled HTML help. In recent years, the department has sought out XML solutions to maintain source for these documents efficiently.</p>

<p>I've been involved with a number of projects to transform text between Adobe FrameMaker and HTML.</p>

<p>In one project, I helped to develop a process by which FrameMaker source could be transformed into HTML using only open-source and free tools, such as ImageMagick, GhostScript and PERL. This process was developed as a way to address a limited availablility of FrameMaker licenses.</p>

<p>It's not an easy process -- Maker Interchange Format (MIF) files are transformed to XML, which are then further transformed to HTML. Imported images are extracted from the MIF and converted to PNG.</p>

<p>Another project involved converting source for a compiled HTML Help file into a proprietary XML schema, then creating HTML source from that XML again.</p>

<h3>NI TechComm: Localization Project Manager</h3>

<p>In April 2006, I was tasked to perform some administrative duties related to the localization of National Instruments documents. These duties included the creation of part numbers in various systems -- one web-based -- and updating a spreadsheet detailing the status of document in the localization process.</p>

<p>It was a tedious, manual task, and I got fed up by it after a few months. So I built a web-based tool to cut down on the manual tasks.</p>

<p>The spreadsheet moved to a MySQL database and rendered dynamically with data scraped from another in-house, proprietary web tool. Firefox plug-ins were developed to faciliate very low-level communication between the two. The Localization Project Manager also generates e-mails at specific points of the process.</p>

<p>Before the development of the Localization Project Manager, it would take 20 minutes per document to finish all the necessary tasks. After development, that process was reduced to a maximum of 5 minutes.</p>

<h3>NI TechComm: Proprietary XML development</h3>

<p>A number of National Instruments in-house projects involved the creation and maintenace of proprietary XML. I've assisted in some of these efforts, developing tools based on these formats.</p>

<p>One such tool is a content management system which updates a clearinghouse listing of department-specific process documentation. The document listings are stored in a database, and the tool generates HTML pages if updated. It also interacts with Perforce, which manages the source of our intranet web sites.</p>

<p>Two other projects dealt with the maintainence of documents in XML. I assisted with developing PERL scripts and XSL templates to transform these XML documents. These scripts and templates were then incorporated into various nightly build processes among different projects.</p>
