<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>Vigilante is not an application itself but the skeleton of
one. You should install Vigilante only in development environments.</p>

<p>Make sure your development environment is fully operational
before extracting Vigilante. For best results, create a separate environment
for Vigilante, with its own document root and local hostname.</p>

<p>To install Vigilante:</p>

<ol>
<li>Extract the Vigilante archive file in the root directory of your development web site.</li>
<li>Create a directory called <code>templates_c</code> in the <code>/includes/smarty/</code> directory. Smarty documentation states your web server must be able to read and write to this directory. Consult with your web hosting service to determine how to change ownership and permissions. Windows environments do not require ownership or permission changes.</li>
</ol>
