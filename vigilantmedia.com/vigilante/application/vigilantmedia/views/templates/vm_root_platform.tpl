<p class="long">In October 1999, I wrote my first PERL script. It was the first step in what would eventually become a significant career shift for me. Although I started out in the Internet industry as a content provider, I've since spent the past few years as a developer.</p>

<p class="long">In that time, I've developed a number of sites with dynamic content powered by PHP and MySQL. Many of these projects recycled the same scripts, and in 2003, it reached a point where there was enough material to standardize all that work.</p>

<p class="long">Enter <strong><a href="{$config.to_vigilante}">Vigilante</a></strong>, an API for web development that simplifies the interaction between web page forms and database queries.</p>

<p class="long">My intention with <strong>Vigilante</strong> is to create a barebones, neutral base on which different applications can be built. It's not a content management application, but you can use it to create one. It's not a database administrator, but it can provide the foundation for one.</p>

<p class="long">The sites featured in this portfolio offer different content, but they're all delivered with the same API.</p>
