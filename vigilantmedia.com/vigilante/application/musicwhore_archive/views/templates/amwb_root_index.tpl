<p>From 1999 to 2005, <strong>Musicwhore.org</strong> was an interactive webzine covering music from far-flung places. Well, mainly Japan. The site consisted of reviews, news and an artist directory, which featured discographies of Japanese artists Romanized for English audiences. While the site reflected my own likes, it also introduced Western audiences to lesser-known artists, providing a resource for readers with non-mainstream tastes.</p>

<p>The site grew to the point where it was too much for a single person to handle, and not desiring to take responsibility for overseeing a staff, I decided to scale it back. Rather than take down all that valuable content, I moved it to an archive instead.</p>

<p>This archive preserves much of the original site. The news and reviews are no longer separated into sections, and while no effort will be taken to make the <a href="/index.php/artists/artist/browse/a/">artist directory</a> thorough, it will reflect updates to keep it in sync with <a href="{$config.to_musicwhore}">new Musicwhore.org content</a>. The interactive audio, however, has been removed.</p>

<p>For all the readers who supported <strong>Musicwhore.org</strong>, financially and otherwise, I thank you.</p>
