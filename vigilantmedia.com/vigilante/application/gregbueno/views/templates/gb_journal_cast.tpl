<p>In case you jump in the middle of <a href="/">&#26085;&#12293;&#12398;&#26412;</a>, you ought to have some context for the individuals mentioned.</p>

<p>Out of concern for <em>outing</em>, I do not use names for certain individuals. Granted, outing can occur through context, but I wish to make identification just a tad harder.</p>

	<dd><p>By now, everyone knows OmarG. Between <a href="http://www.terribly-happy.com/">Terribly Happy</a> and <a href="http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/">Television Without Pity</a>, it's hard not to miss him. We met as interns at the paper and were upstairs-downstairs neighbors at our temporary digs at St. Edward's University.</p>

		<p>I used to refer to Omar in this journal as Officer Funboy, a character he created for <a href="http://www.lcp.org/">the Latino Comedy Project</a>. Funboy is "the most flamboyant cop on the Amsterdam police force." People keep mistaking Omar for gay, and if he keeps creating characters like this one, I'm going to have re-tool my own gaydar.</p>

		<p>Se&ntilde;or Sex was another alter ego used in this journal. Omar kept a sex advice web site of the same name but had to quit when he went legit with American-Statesman <a href="http://www.statesman.com/">business desk</a>
			(i.e. got a job with the paper.)</p>

		<p>For a while, he was editor of a features section called Technopolis, but the downturn in the economy forced some "restructuring". Now, he's an assistant editor.</p></dd>

	<dd><p>Double-A is stands for Andy A. I met Andy through Omar, who knew her from an internship at the Wall Street Journal. We bonded over cigarette breaks -- she was the only one who smoked my brand (Kamel Red Lights.) Eventually, I started hanging out with other metro desk folk through Andy.</p>

		<p>Double-A and I share an affinity for dining, Tarot readings and the <em>I Ching</em>.</p></dd>

	<dd><p>My rock en Espa&ntilde;ol buddy. She introduced me to Caf� Tacuba, and my CD colleciton hasn't been the same.</p>

		<p>We didn't really hang out with each other until Man� and the Watcha Tour came to Texas. We also have a lot of the same newsroom friends -- namely, Funboy.</p>

		<p>So hanging out pretty much became inevitable.</p>

		<p>Our first excursion to Oilcan Harry's for a strip show revealed the extent of Jesse's willingness to party -- especially with guys with whom she wouldn't have a snowball's chance in blast furnace. For that, she is also refered to as "Shameless."</p></dd>

	<dd><p>From 1995 to 1997, Ryan Ozawa was my partner in crime, a relationship we continue to a lesser extent over many thousands of miles of ocean.</p>

		<p>He was the editor-in-chief of the University of Hawai&acute;i student newspaper for two years. One of those years, I was his managing editor. Our working relationship was so tight, people actually started to think he dumped his then-girlfriend Jen for me!</p>

		<p>Now, he not only has a <a href="http://www.ozawa.org/jen/">wife</a> but a <a href="http://www.ozawa.org/katie/">daughter</a> as well.</p>

		<p>Ryan does a better job of <a href="http://www.lightfantastic.org/imr/people/greg.html">describing our adventures</a>. He is also the author of the excellent <a href="http://www.lightfantastic.org/imr/">In Medias Res</a>, a journal much neglected.</p></dd>

	<dd><p>Jennifer Eno Ozawa and I are the same age, which means she lived through the 80s step-by-step with me. We both saw the rise and fall of Duran Duran. We both remember things our younger friends failed to learn. And we both have this unmistakable ability to act young and feel old.</p>

		<p>According to Ryan, she thought I was one of the cuter guys working for Ka Leo. She doesn't remember saying that.</p>

		<p>Jen is now wife, mother and happy ex-service industry employee. She wrote the excellent <a href="http://www.ozawa.org/jen/journal/">Hale Kilinahe</a> before turning into a full-time mom.</p></dd>

	<dd>A major protagonist from 1997 to 1998 of the <em>Book of Days</em>. A one-time close friend for whom I felt more than he could reciprocate, thereby queering our friendship, so to speak.

	<dd>A guy I dated from February 1998 to November 1998. Sweet man, a good 15 years my senior. We stopped being intimate in June 1998, thereby allowing the entrance of another in November 1998. Don't know what's up with him.
	<dt><strong><a id="jfk">former boyfriend</a></strong>
	<dd>Our relationship spanned from Dec. 1996 to May 1997. We met through mutual friends, and he came out to me. We embarked on a rocky relationship, marred by our inexperience at dating, an inequity in our affection, improbably incidents of infidelity and sex.

	<dd>Typical gay encounter: falling in love with your best friend in high school. This particular case was unrequited, on the count that he is straight.
