Volunteer Opportunities
</h5>
<p>
If you are nearby, in body or in spirit, and would like to donate time 
and/or energy to help us make this a really dynamic conference, please 
<a href="mailto:jcon@journalcon.austin-stories.com">email the Committee</a>.  The more the merrier! We will need 
help in these months of preparation, as well as onsite the weekend of 
the event.
</p>
<p>
Volunteers will receive unheard-of perks and props. And, we do truly 
mean "unheard-of" -- we've not nailed down exactly how volunteers will 
be rewarded. But it will certainly be cool and worthwhile.  Maybe Omar 
will do a special dance for you.

<h5>
The Texas Two-Step Registration
</h5>
<p>
Here's a little Lone Star love for our neighbors: Texans registering for Web
Writers Weekend had the option to pay in two installments -- an early
deposit of $20, and a second payment of $35.
</p>
<p>
$20.00 was to be paid by July 1, 2003. Unfortunately the Texas Two-Step is no longer available to attendees who did not register by that time.
The remainder ($35.00) is due no later than 11:59 pm CDT, September 15, 2003.</p>
