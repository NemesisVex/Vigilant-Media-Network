<h5>
When is the event?
</h5>
<p>
Friday, October 17 - Sunday, October 19, 2003.  To attend all official conference events, one should plan to arrive in Austin by 5:00 p.m.
 on Friday evening, and depart no earlier than 2:00 pm on Sunday. We understand that not everyone will be able to meet that schedule; 
 consequently, the bulk of the panels and programming will be on Saturday, and Sunday morning.

What if I am in Austin already?
</h5>
<p>
Conference attendees are not required to stay at the Omni (although we are not arranging for discounted rates at any other locations). 
 Those who do not stay at the Omni will be considered day attendees.  Please see the Registration page for information to help you plan 
 your trip.

<p>
Please note that guests will be the responsibility of their host, and do not receive a discounted registration rate of any kind.

<p>
The funds are used for conference expenses.  Conference programming is not open to the public; your registration guarantees your 
admission to all conference events that weekend.
