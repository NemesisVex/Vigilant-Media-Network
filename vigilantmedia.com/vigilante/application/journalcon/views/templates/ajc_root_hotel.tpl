<b>As we expected, the JournalCon room block at the Omni has been filled.  
There is a slim chance that more rooms at the Omni will become available in
 September -- if so, we will let you know, but we <i>do not expect that to happen</i>.
 If you are planning on attending Web Writers Weekend and have not made accommodation 
 arrangements, you need to call our official overflow hotel, the Radisson on Town Lake. 
  <a href="radisson.php">Please read the information at the Overflow Hotel page.</a></b>

Omni Austin</a>, a four-star
four-diamond  facility in the heart of the city, as the official conference
hotel. They are offering a very competitive room rate for our attendees.
<b>To make reservations, please call the Omni at (512) 476-3700.  Please be

<p>
All rooms feature executive desks, dual-line phone with modem and voice
mail, cable TV, Nintendo, armoires, Web TV, hair dryers, iron and ironing
boards, and mini-bars. The Omni also has suites available with walk-in
closet, Jacuzzi bath and full kitchen ­ please contact the Committee if you
are interested in staying in a suite during your visit.
Single or double occupancy rooms are $119.00 per night.  Guests may choose
from one king or two double beds, and smoking or non-.  Each additional
person in a room (up to 4 total) is $20.00.  These prices do not include
local hotel tax of 15%. </p>
<p>
The Omni has graciously offered the conference rate for the evenings of
Thursday, October 16 and Sunday, October 19 as well, so we encourage you to
extend your trip to Austin and take advantage of the great rate at this
lovely hotel.</p>
<p>
You need not be registered for the conference to go ahead and reserve rooms
at the hotel.  Attendees will be responsible for their own reservations.  We
have booked a limited number of rooms at the Omni, and cannot guarantee the
reserved rate once that block is gone, so we encourage you to make your
hotel arrangements right away.
</p>
<p>
The Omni has an extremely friendly reservation procedure:  a credit card
must be used to reserve a room, but <b>it will not be charged until
check-out</b>.  "Absolutely no advance charges" was promised to us in
writing by the hotel.  Upon check-in, the equivalent of one night's stay
will be held against the credit card, but not actually charged; upon
check-out, guests may choose to pay however they like.   If the credit card
is not used, the hold will be released.  </p>
<p>
In light of this policy, the hotel does require two days' notice for
cancellation ­ otherwise a cancellation charge equal to one night's stay
will be charged to the card.   <b>If you need to cancel your reservation
with the Omni, to avoid charges, you must call by 3:00 PM CST on Wednesday,
October 15.</b>
</p>
<p>
FYI, itinerary will be confirmed with individual guests upon check-in, at
which time they will be given the opportunity to adjust their departure date
if needed.    After that, an early departure fee of $50.00 will be charged
should you check out prior to the confirmed departure date. </p>
<p>
Parking is available at the hotel for $14.00 for overnight valet, $10.00 for
covered overnight self-parking with in-and-out privileges, and $8.00 for
covered self-parking for day attendees.  This can be arranged upon arrival.
</p>
<p>
To make reservations, please call the Omni at (512) 476-3700.  Let the
reservation agent know that you are attending JournalCon to receive the
conference rate.  If you call the toll-free number or make reservations
through the Omni's online feature, we cannot guarantee the conference room
rate; please let the Committee know if you have questions.
