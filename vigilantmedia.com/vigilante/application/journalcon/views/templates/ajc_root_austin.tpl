              <p><b>Top Ten Reasons We're Glad JournalCon 2003 Will Be in Austin:</b> </p>
              <p>10. A kickass <a href="http://www.austin-stories.com/">Austin 
                journalling community</a>, along with many other <a href="http://koax.org/austin/index.php" target="blank">local 
                folks</a> who keep <a href="http://www.austinbloggers.org/" target="blank">weblogs or personal Web pages</a>. We're ready 
                to show you the best places downtown for live music, hot coffee, 
                cold beer, and other diversions. </p>
              <p>9. Central Texas doesn't mean only Austin. Remember, we're driving 
                distance for journallers living in San Antonio, <a href="http://www.dfwblogs.com" target="blank">Dallas</a>, 
                and <a href="http://h-townblogs.blogspot.com" target="blank">Houston</a>. </p>
              <p>8. Tons of cool coffee spots downtown, including <a href="http://www.littlecity.com/index2.html" target="blank">Little 
                City</a>, Ruta Maya, Jo's, <a href="http://www.halcyonaustin.com" target="blank">Halcyon</a>, 
                <a href="http://www.thehideout.org/" target="blank">The Hideout</a>, and Spider House. 
                (Yes, there's a Starbucks too, but we were <a href="http://www.austinunique.com/" target="blank">thinking 
                locally</a>.) For you non-coffee drinkers, <a href="http://www.jambajuice.com/where/index.html#TX" target="blank">Jamba 
                Juice</a> is also downtown. </p>
              <p>7. We love our food here, as you can tell by the number of downtown 
                restaurants, including traditional Tex-Mex, Central American, 
                <a href="http://www.austinsushi.com/" target="blank">sushi</a>, seafood, authentic 
                Mexican food, vegetarian, and vegan. Most important, we have lots 
                and <a href="http://www.austin360.com/aas/dining/dining_guide_02/barbecue.html" target="blank">lots</a> 
                of <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/vol18/issue38/food.bbq.html" target="blank">barbecue</a>, 
                be it brisket or tofu. You can sample some of the city's best 
                cuisine&#0151;Salt Lick BBQ, Amy's Ice Cream, and Matt's El Rancho&#0151;without 
                leaving the airport. </p>
              <p>6. Some of those coffeehouses and restaurants have <a href="http://austinwireless.net/" target="blank">wireless 
                Internet access</a>. We're hoping to get you as much access as 
                possible for JournalCon, so bring your laptop and you'll have 
                no excuses for not updating. </p>
              <p>5. There's a reason why Austin has been billed as the <a href="http://www.austinlivemusic.com/">live 
                music</a> capital of the world. Whatever your favorite style of 
                music, you're likely to find it downtown when you visit for JournalCon. 
              </p>
              <p>4. Having you visit us will help <a href="http://www.keepaustinweird.com/" target="blank">Keep 
                Austin Weird</a>. </p>
              <p>3. We've got a nightlife you can't shake a stick at, but can 
                shake your ass to. </p>
              <p>2. <a href="http://www.shiner.com/" target="blank">Shiner Beer</a>. Need we elaborate? 
              </p>
              <p>1. The economy here sucks, so if you vote for Austin, Omar can't 
                give you a dollar. On the other hand, we should be able to find 
                you some of the most affordable fun around. </p>
            </ul>
