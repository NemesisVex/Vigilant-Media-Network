						<h2>About Eponymous 4</h2>
					</header>
					
					<article>
						<p><strong>Eponymous 4</strong>, if you're familiar with your college music history, is a play on <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_IV">Anonymous IV</a></strong>, an English music student whose writings documented French music from the Middle Ages. <strong><a href="http://www.anonymous4.com/">Anonymous 4</a></strong> is also the name of a vocal quartet specializing in Medieval music.</p>

						<p><strong>Eponymous 4</strong> was a name I chose randomly when posting files to MP3.com, back when it was an independent artist repository. I didn't want to put them under my own name, but I had no idea what name I wanted to use. Over time, the name grew on me, and I decided to stick with it.</p>

						<p>For the most part, <strong>Eponymous 4</strong> is a home studio project. I made some baby steps in 2001 to build a studio but didn't gain momentum till 2005. Since then, I've been working madly in my laboratory -- actually, I call it the Closet -- and I think I've got enough material to start unveiling to the public.</p>
						
						<p>All <strong>Eponymous 4</strong> recordings are released through <strong><a href="http://observantrecords.com/">Observant Records</a></strong>, and publishing is administered by <strong>Shinkyoku Advocacy</strong> (ASCAP).</p>

						<h2>About Greg Bueno</h2>
					</header>

					<article>
						<p>My first piano lessons were in 1985, when I was 13 years old. A year later, I began writing songs and continued through high school. By college, I became a music major, and songwriting gave way to many unfinished forrays into composition. Journalism, however, derailed my music studies, and I ended up with bachelor's degree in both fields.</p>

						<p>I moved to Austin, Texas, in 1997, and from time to time, I would take in a music class at Austin Community College, where I learned the basics of multitrack recording and the potential of home studio recording.</p>

						<p>By day, I work as a web developer at an Austin-based technology company. Web development is how I've earned most of my living, but as circumstances deemed fit, I've been a journalist and record store employee as well.</p>
