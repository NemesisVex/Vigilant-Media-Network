		<p>Crux just thought it was another night of hunting – of seeking out those who would prey on humankind. Instead, the novice hunter ends up killing Thomas, one of the most powerful immortals in New York City, and starts a turf war that puts a bullseye on his back.</p>

		<p>Too bad for his would-be captors. Thomas' death awakens in Crux a dormant power so strong, nobody – not even Crux himself – can fathom it.</p>

		<p>And he's just getting started ...</p>

		<h3>About the novel</h3>

		<p>Crux has been a character that had been hanging around the edges of my consciousness since 1991. I've tried numerous times to set down his story, but I couldn't get his voice right.</p>

		<p>On my last attempt, I let two friends read the results, and they were eager to know what would happen to him. So I hunkered down and finished the story in 2009.</p>

		<p><em>Starting to Remember</em> is the result.</p>

		<p>And it only took 18 years.</p>

		<h3>Why free?</h3>

		<p>Crux isn't done with his adventures, but I don't consider myself as a full-time novelist. I did finish a literary novel back in 2001, which will remain unpublished.</p>

		<p>It took 8 years before I got around to finishing this story, 18 if you count the first drafts from 1991.</p>

		<p>In short, don't make any bets on when the next Crux story will surface.</p>

		<p>But I'd rather have some readers than no readers, and maybe if enough people like this tale, they'll put on the heat to make me finish another.</p>
