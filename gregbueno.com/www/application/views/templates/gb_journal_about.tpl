<p>In 1996, I got involved in a fiction.</p>

<p>Ophelia Z was created in a musty, hot newsroom as a reaction against the online ramblings of a ditsy UH student. I was cast as Kat's gay ex-boyfriend, and in order to give the illusion Kat existed, a few of us agreed to become Kat's acquaintences and to link to her web journal.</p>

<p>Although I didn't really read Kat's first entries, the idea of keeping a journal on the web piqued my curiosity. Egged on by "Kat" herself, I started a journal on my University of Hawai&acute;i account titled <em><strong>Book of Days</strong></em>.</p>

<p>It turned out the journal would document a rather turbulent series of events in my life at the time -- my first relationship with another man, moving from Hawai&acute;i to Texas, more unrequited love, a burglary.</p>

<p>As years went by, the journal changed and moved and moved and expanded. It was called <strong><em>9 79242-2</em></strong> at one point and even managed to chalk up a nomination for a 2000 SXSW Web Award for Best Online Journal. In 2001, it even won a Diarist.net Award for Most Experimental Journal. (By that time, it had turned into a webzine called <strong><em>Musicwhore.org</em></strong>.)</p>

<p>But like most endeavors that last a long time, the energy to maintain it ran out. In July 2002, the online journal I kept for six years went on hiatus. I wrote in a paper journal for a while, then realized I was neglecting <em>that</em> journal as well.</p>

<p>In December 2002, I finally made good on a threat to build a portal around a list of Austin-based journals. <a href="http://www.austin-stories.com/">Austin Stories</a> launched a month later, and I found myself wanting to participate in it. So this journal was reinstated.</p>

<p>I've collected all the hard-coded entries, stripped out most of the formatting and present them here in this central location.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> I've made no attempt to fix any broken links or missing scripts. Plus, earlier entries often mention or link to sites which no longer exist. (Ah, the trouble with a dated medium.) Click/submit at your own risk!</p>

<p>And because it feels like starting over, I'm using the title it started out with, albeit not quite in the same way!</p>

<p>Thanks to all the folks who've read this journal in its many forms.</p>

<p>This statement details how the identity of other people mentioned in <strong><a href="/">��X�̖{</a></strong> are handled:

<ul>
<li><strong>I rarely talk about work.</strong> This medium is publication, and writing about work in <strong>musicwhore.org</strong> is equivalent to being on-the-record.
<li><strong>I make scant references to my family.</strong> They value their privacy, and I respect that.
<li><strong>Not everyone mentioned in the book is real.</strong> Out of the interest of possible <em>outing</em>, some people mentioned in <strong>��X�̖{</strong> may either be composites or extracts of individuals. While identification may be gleaned through context, I try to keep things vague enough for <em>outing</em> not to happen.
<li><strong>Password protection</strong>. In instances when I must break any of these rules, I'll password protect specific entries. This method serves a compromise. Readers still have access to the entries, but I can practice some sense of control over the audience.
