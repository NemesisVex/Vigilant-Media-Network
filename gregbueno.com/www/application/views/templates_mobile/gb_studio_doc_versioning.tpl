<h2>Versioning</h2>

<p>To keep track of the different versions of each project, use a naming convention similar to software versioning: <em>major.minor.revision.build</em></p>

<p>The <strong>major</strong> number applies to the entire catalog. This number reflects changes made across all albums. It's an unconventional use of a major number, but one that insures parallel naming between different albums.</p>

<p>The <strong>minor</strong> number applies to an album. This number indicates different versions of the same set of catalog changes. For example, an album may be labeled version if 1.1 all tracks were processed with a limiter. An album may be labeled version 2.0 if the tracks include instruments not previously used in version 1.1.</p>

<p>The <strong>revision</strong> number applies to different version of an album. For example, version 2.0.0 of an album may contain temporary melody tracks. Version 2.0.1 of an album may contain no melody tracks.</p>

<p>The <strong>build</strong> number applies <em>only</em> to older or alternate versions of an album track. The most current version of a track will contain no build number. For example, the original key of a track is C-minor. The track is then transposed to A-minor and becomes the definitive version. The definitive track is labeled version 2.0.0. The previous version is then labeled 2.0.0.0. An alternate version of the A-minor track is created but does <em>not</em> replace the definitive version. That version is labeled 2.0.0.2 to indicate indirectly that 2.0.0.1 is the definitive version. Alphabetical characters may be applied to the build number to indicate <em>alpha</em>, <em>beta</em> or <em>release candidate</em> versions of a track.</p>

<p>Version numbers are strictly internal. When (or if) a song reaches its final version, version numbers are elimnated.</p>

<h3>File names</h3>

<p>Version numbers precede file names surrounded by brackets. Periods are not used. For example, a file named &quot;[200] 01 - Eponymous 4 - The One to Make Me Whole.mp3&quot; is version 2.0.0 of that track.</p>

<h3>Version history</h3>

<p>The following list details the version numbers currently in use.</p>

<ul>
	<li> <strong>0.0.0:</strong> These tracks are source material for covers or early drafts of original songs.</li>
	<li> <strong>1.0.0:</strong> These tracks were not processed with a limiter, and guitar tracks were substituted with clavier path on a keyboard. <em>This version number has been obsoleted. No files may be prefixed with this version number.</em></li>
	<li> <strong>1.1.0:</strong> These tracks were processed with a limiter. No guitar tracks are included. This version number applies to albums that do <em>not</em> employ Propellerhead Reason.</li>
	<li> <strong>1.1.1:</strong> These tracks mirror version 1.1.0 without a temporary melody track. This version is also called the <em>karaoke</em> version.</li>
	<li> <strong>2.0.0:</strong> These tracks were processed with a limiter and employ Propellerhead Reason for guitars and additional parts. If any album requires the use of Reason, this version number is used, even if it never iterates through version 1.1. This skip insures parallel naming across albums.</li>
