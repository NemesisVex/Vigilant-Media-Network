<p>So. I guess this is where I get to summarize my life up to this point.</p>

<p>I wrote one such self-biography back in the early days of the web, and damn did I take myself way too seriously back then. (And to think that was about five years ago as of this writing!)</p>

<p>I'm going to pillage from the text and answer the question -- how the hell did I end up like this?</p>

<p>First, where am I from? Honolulu Hawai&acute;i. Sounds exotic, but trust me -- the disparity between reality and Convention and Visitor Bureau marketing is wide. I was raised Catholic, and I've been recovering ever since. My dad is an electrician, my mom a nurse, and they both come from the Philippines. Which means I'm first generation.</p>

<p>I started early when it came to amassing a huge record collection -- second grade, in fact -- but my interest in music didn't really skyrocket till I took piano lessons in seventh grade. (Or was it when I developed a crush on Roger Taylor of Duran Duran?) I was a lousy piano student -- mainly because I ended up using my piano lessons as songwriting lessons instead.</p>

<p>I did the high school band thing and hated every minute of it. I only stayed in because I knew I had the Best Musician Award locked at the end of the year. My band instructor even had to custom-make a final exam in my senior year -- I had to figure out the flute solo of a song and perform it on the keyboards at a grade school graduation. Everyone else got off by playing a B-flat major scale.</p>

<p>I've always been into computers, but my parents were incredibly wise not to buy me one. They knew I'd spend all my time in front of it -- like I do now. (Cough, cough). I was fascinated by the Classic Video Games of the early 80s, but after the Karate Champ paradigm took over, I couldn't channel them.</p>

<p>Now -- how the heck did I end up in journalism? I should have probably seen the writing on the wall when I won the journalism and music medals at my high school graduation. I tried to concentrate on my music studies in my first few semesters of college, but I wrote for the Hunter College paper while I was studying in New York back in 1992. And I liked it. I joined the staff of Ka Leo O Hawai&acute;i when I returned to Honolulu, and that's when my soul was sold to the liberal media, lock, stock and the proverbial barrell.</p>

<p>As for my sexual orientation -- I should have seen that one when I developed a crush on Sting, Huey Lewis and various members of Duran Duran when I was a kid. Coming out wasn't easy, and I probably have to say I'm not as open as I probably ought to be. I fell in love with my best friend in high school, and he couldn't return my feelings. Ah! Heartbreak! Took me f--king five years to get over him, dammit.</p>

<p>I came out when I decided to cover National Coming Out Day for a class assignment. I wanted to see if I could stay in the closet after I finished writing the article. Hah. One of my sources was a guy I had a crush on, and who I didn't really expect to be gay. He was my incentive, so to speak.</p>

<p>I moved to Austin, Texas in 1997 to work for Austin360.com. I stayed with the site for three years, even though two of them weren't all that much fun. I had a huge crush on my co-worker, and we had a falling out when he was snatched up by one of those fancy-schmancy dot-coms.</p>

<p>That's not to say the entire experience sucked -- I got to cover SXSW for two years, and I saw a whole slew of Japanese bands. Unfortunately, I discovered my favorite artist, Cocco, <em>after</em> she performed. Argh. (I did, however, catch both Number Girl appearances.)</p>

<p>Even though my dating life has been a total wash, Austin is really a good place to hear music. Duran Duran never played once in Honolulu, but I got to see them <em>twice</em> after I moved to Texas. Some shows I fondly remember are eX-Girl, the Watcha Tour, Emmylou Harris, Sade, Ozomatli ... I could go on.</p>

<p>Knowing I didn't have the corporate mentality to work my way up the Cox Interactive Media food chain, I took a class in Perl, started programming my personal sites, and found a development job with Supportkids, Inc. So far, that's been my dream job. I got to work with the backend of a web site, and I improved my skills mightily. The paycheck I earned was enough to get me a whole bunch of music equipment.</p>

<p>Of course, like most dot-com jobs, mine was eliminated. I spent most of my unemployed time watching <em>Law and Order</em> re-runs and playing Sinistar on MAME. I half-heartedly went to some web-related job interviews, but as the unemployment checks started to run out, I applied for some retail jobs.</p>

<p>Right around SXSW 2002, I was asked to interview with Waterloo Records, hands-down the best record store in town. I was hired, and I stayed with the store for a year. <em>That</em> was definitely my dream job. Sure, paying bills on my salary was depressing, and I downright despise garage rock as a result of my time there. But I felt alive while I worked, and hell -- I lost a few pounds, too.</p>

<p>I'm probably going to gain them all back, now that I've started a new job with another technology company in Austin. It's only been a month so far, and for now, I'm considered a temp. I had planned on moving from Austin later in the year if I didn't find a new job, but now that I have, we'll see ...</p>

<p>That's it so far. I end this self-written bio with a poll I took many years ago.</p>
